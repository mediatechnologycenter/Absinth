<img src="images/absinth_logo.png" alt="image" width="300" height="auto">  <br/>
Absinth is a human-annotated dataset for faithfulness detection in the context of German news summarization.
The dataset has 4335 instances in total, where each instance consists of the following elements:
1. **News Article**: The original news article from the [20Minuten](https://github.com/ZurichNLP/20Minuten/tree/main/SwissText_2023) dataset.
2. **Summary-Sentence**: A machine-generated summary-sentence of the news article. The sentence is generated by one of the following language models:
   - _mBART_ : multilingual BART fine-tuned on _20Minuten_. 
   - _mLongT5_: multilingual LongT5 fine-tuned on _20Minuten_.
   - _Gpt4_: zero-shot summary by Gpt4.
   - _Gpt4-Intrinsic_: zero-shot summary containing synthetic Intrinsic Hallucinations by Gpt4.
   - _Gpt4-Extrinsic_: zero-shot summary containing synthetic Extrinsic Hallucination by Gpt4.
   - _Stable-Beluga-2_: zero-shot summary by [StableBeluga2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/StableBeluga2), a Llama2-70B model fine-tuned on an Orca style Dataset.
   - _Llama2-7B_: base Llama2-7B model fine-tuned on _20Minuten_ using QLora.
3. **Label**: The label categorizes the relationship between the news article and the summary-sentence. The label can be one of the following three values:
   - Faithful: The information in the sentence is consistent with the news article, without contradicting or adding external information.
   - Intrinsic Hallucination: The sentence contradicts the information in the article.
   - Extrinsic Hallucination: The sentence contains information not present in the article.
